			<h2>The Ultimate Screen Recorder Online: Free, Unlimited, and Private üé•</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>Capture Your Screen Without Limits or Worries</h3>
			<p>Tired of complex software, confusing sign-ups, and restrictive time limits? Welcome to the simplest, most
				secure way to capture your desktop or mobile screen. Our <strong>online screen recorder</strong> is
				designed for
				speed and privacy, working entirely within your browser to deliver truly
				<strong>unlimited screen recording time</strong> at
				no cost.</p>
			<p><strong>Record your screen with no time limit for free with audio.</strong></p>
			<p>We believe screen recording should be effortless. Whether you‚Äôre creating a tutorial, capturing a bug
				report, or saving a live stream, our tool ensures your focus remains on your content, not on countdown
				timers or
				watermarks.
			</p>
			<h3>Your Privacy is Our Priority: The Power of Local Recording</h3>
			<p>Unlike most web applications, our screen recording solution operates on a <strong>no-backend</strong>
				architecture.
			</p>
			<p>This is a critical difference: the entire recording process is handled by <strong>JavaScript</strong>
				using your device&#39;s native capabilities. Your recorded media remains 100% within your browser‚Äôs
				<strong>local storage</strong>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Zero Uploads:</strong> Your private videos are <em>never</em> transmitted to our servers or
					any third party. </li>
				<li><strong>Complete Control:</strong> You control the files, from viewing and renaming to permanent
					deletion. </li>
				<li><strong>Instant Access:</strong> Once you stop recording, the video is immediately available for
					<strong>preview</strong> and <strong>download</strong>. You can also monitor your browser&#39;s
					allocated and used storage space right on the page.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Effortless Management of Your Screen Captures</h3>
			<p>Keeping your workspace organized is easy. All your video sessions are displayed in a clean, card-based
				interface, neatly categorized by their recorded dates.</p>
			<p><strong>Key Features for Managing Your Recordings:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Quick Actions:</strong> Each recording card provides instant access to
					<strong>delete</strong>,
					<strong>rename</strong>, <strong>preview</strong>, and <strong>download</strong> buttons. Renaming
					is
					smart‚Äîwe
					automatically sanitize your file names by replacing spaces with hyphens (-) and removing other
					non-allowed
					characters for clean file management. </li>
				<li><strong>Preview Mode:</strong> Click the <strong>Preview</strong> button to instantly open a modal
					with
					a video
					player, allowing you to quickly review your recording before committing to a download or deletion.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> For power users, managing large volumes of recordings is
					streamlined.
					Simply
					click any recording card to select it. When one or more clips are selected, a fixed &#39;Delete
					All&#39;
					button
					appears at the bottom of the page, allowing you to remove multiple files simultaneously after a
					simple
					confirmation.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Intuitive, Always-Ready Controls</h3>
			<p>The interface is designed for maximum efficiency. The <strong>Start Recording</strong> button remains
				conveniently
				fixed at the bottom of your screen. When recording begins, it is instantly replaced by the necessary
				<strong>Pause</strong> and <strong>Stop</strong> buttons, which remain fixed for easy access throughout
				your
				session. If you hit &#39;Pause&#39;, it seamlessly changes to a &#39;Resume&#39; button, ensuring you
				never
				miss a
				moment.</p>

					<div class="message-header">Is this screen recorder genuinely free and unlimited?</div>
					<div class="message-body">
						Yes, absolutely! We offer <strong>unlimited screen recording time</strong> at no cost. There
						are no premium features, no mandatory sign-ups, and no hidden fees to unlock full
						functionality. Use it as often as you need, for as long as you need.

					<div class="message-header">Where are my recordings saved and how private are they?</div>
					<div class="message-body">
						Your recordings are saved <em>only</em> in your browser&#39;s local storage on the specific
						device you used for recording. They are completely <strong>private</strong> because we
						operate on a no-backend model, meaning the video files are
						<strong>never uploaded</strong> to the internet or any server we control. Your data stays
						with you.

					<div class="message-header">Does this tool record both my screen and my voice?</div>
					<div class="message-body">
						Yes, it does! When you click &#39;Start Recording&#39;, your browser will prompt you to
						grant permissions for both your screen/window/tab and your microphone. This capability
						allows you to create comprehensive tutorials, voice-over presentations, and interactive
						walkthroughs with synchronized audio.

					</div>
					<div class="message-body">
						<strong>Nobody is watching you!</strong> Your browser (like Chrome or Firefox) is just
						asking for your permission to access your screen so it can <em>record it</em>. This is a
						standard security step. We only use that access to save the video file <em>locally</em> on
						your device. Once you stop recording, the permission goes away.

						Great observation! We offer <strong>unlimited recording time</strong>, which means we
						don&#39;t force you to stop. However, to finish, you must click the big
						<strong>Stop</strong>
						button that appears at the bottom of the page. Don&#39;t worry about filling up your whole

						The <strong>Start Recording</strong> button is always fixed at the very bottom of the page!
						It only disappears when you are actively recording (and is replaced by the Pause/Stop

						Don&#39;t worry, your recording is absolutely being saved! That storage number is

						The delete button worked perfectly! Because the storage information is
						<strong>not a live feed</strong>, you won&#39;t see the number drop immediately. The space
						has been freed up, but the display will only update when the app next checks the

						The app itself <strong>does not have a color setting</strong> you can change. It
						automatically detects and uses whatever color mode (Dark Mode or Light Mode) you have set up

					<div class="message-body">
						That&#39;s a great request, and we hear you! Right now, our system is built for speed and
